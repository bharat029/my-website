# My Website

This is the source code for my personal website. 


## Highlights

- Developed using Angular and Firebase.
- Dynamic website with almost all of the content being stored in Firestore Database.
- Has an Admin Panel that can be access by navigating to `/admin` path.
- Admin Panel requires authentication accomplished with Firebase Auth.
- Apart from just the content the Profile Image and Resume can also be updated directly via the Admin Panel.
- Additionally, uses Firebase for Storage and Hosting as well.
- Uses Route Animations to make smooth page transitions.
- All modules are Lazy Loaded hence the actual size of the website for the user is relatively low, since most of the size is because of the Admin Panel. 
- This website is also responsive.
